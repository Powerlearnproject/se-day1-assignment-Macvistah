#Part 1 Answers

Software Engineering is the designing, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products and computer applications. This is done by adhereing to engineering principles, methods and tools.
The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Milestones are:
1.) Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C). - This was to exploit the the limited hardware resources hence facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging.
2.) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. The discipline allowed the development of specification documents for business management software.
3.) Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. - Promoted a disciplined project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation. Methodology based on iterative development.

Phases of software development cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Waterfall and Agile methodologies
Agile uses iterative sprints to develop core functionalities and adds user feedback regularly, example used in tech startup developing a mobile app, while waterfall method follows a strict sequence from requirements gathering to maintenance, with no overlap between phases, example it is used in government software for public records.
Agile has rapid prototype releases, with frequent revisions based on A/B testing and user analytics , eg used in E-commerce website redesign, while waterfall has detailed project phases from architectural design to construction, following a precise blueprint, eg used in construction of a new corporate office.

Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager
Software developer - responsible for creating software applications and programs.
Quality Assuarance Engineer - ensure that the software being developed is of high quality, meets specified requirements, and is free from bugs and errors.
Project Manager - responsible for the overall planning, execution, and control of a project.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS)
IDEs helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Example of an IDE is Visual studio code.
VCS enables better management, tracking, and implementation of changes to code and related files by providing a structured approach to revision control, VCS supports dynamic, collaborative environments, providing stability across development projects. Example is Git.

challenges faced by software engineers.
Complexity: Use design patterns and architecture principles to simplify the software systems and make it easy to understand and manage.
Meeting Deadlines: Use project management techniques such as Agile development and Scrum to plan and manage work effectively.
Keeping up with new technologies: Continuously learn and explore new technologies and programming languages to stay current.
Managing changing requirements: Use flexible development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum to handle changing requirements effectively.

different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance).
Unit Testing - is a strategy where individual code units (functions, methods, classes) are isolated and tested independently focusing on verifying each unit's internal logic and functionality to ensure they operate as expected. Example is testing an edge case in calculations function.
Integration Testing - verifies how individual software components (modules) work together after being unit-tested focusing on ensuring individual software pieces. Example is testing the interaction between the product catalog module and the shopping cart module to confirm that accurate product information and prices are entered.
System Testing - a comprehensive evaluation of a software system's overall functionality and performance to ensure that the entire system meets the development criteria. Example is testing a social networking app in the scenario of uploading and sharing a post.
Acceptance Testing - ensures the software functions properly in the user's working environment determining whether the software fits the business requirements and user acceptance criteria as expected or not. Example is user acceptance testing the check out process in ecommerce website.

# Part 2 Answers
Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs.
Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. 
It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data. 
It enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input. 

vague - can you paint a picture that may symbolize freedom but has no red paints.
clear prompt - picture of a broken chain.
The improved prompt is more effective since it narrows to the specific set of data thus faster generation.
